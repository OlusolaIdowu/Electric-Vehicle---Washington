## Do you know that Electric Vehicles are fast becoming popular in the United States? 

Let's take a look at Washington which happens to be the third U.S. state with the most EVs, where Electric Vehicles have taken center stage, silently navigating the urban landscapes, weaving through the evergreen valleys, and cruising along the shores of the Puget Sound

# Data Overview
The Electric Vehicle (EV) analysis was conducted to gain insights into electric vehicle registration and distribution patterns in Washington, based on data from the Department of Licensing (DOL). The data used for this analysis was sourced from the Washington State Department of Licensing (updated Dec 16, 2023) and includes key information such as VIN, County, City, Electric Vehicle Type, Legislative District, Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Eligibility, Electric Range, Base MSRP, and Electric Utility.

# Data Cleaning
The dataset comprises information on 163,003 electric vehicles registered in Washington. The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. Rows with information not related to Washington were dropped, as they do not have Washington DOL Vehicle ID. Additionally, electric utility company names were standardized to ensure accurate analysis.
